The current bundled Typescript definitions are incomplete and based around the needs of the developers who contributed them.

Pull requests to improve them are welcome and appreciated. If you've never contributed to open source before, then you may find [this free video course](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) helpful.
