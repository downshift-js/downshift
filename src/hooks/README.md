# Downshift Hooks

A set of hooks to build simple, flexible, WAI-ARIA compliant React dropdown
components. Developed as a follow up on [this issue][hooks-issue] about using
hooks in our API.

## Hooks

Check out one of the hooks below to use in your application and create fully
accessible widgets without any constraint about the UI used.

### useSelect

For a custom `select` dropdown [click here][select-readme].

### useCombobox

For a `combobox/autocomplete` dropdown [click here][combobox-readme].

### useMultipleSelection

For a `multiple selection` with a `select` or `combobox` [click
here][multiple-selection-readme].

## Roadmap and contributions

Next steps:

- iterate on `useSelect`, `useCombobox`, `useMultipleSelection` to make them
  better and more robust.
- plan the development of hooks for other widgets that require a11y, for
  instance carousels, split buttons, trees, etc.
