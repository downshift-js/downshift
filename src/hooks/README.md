# Downshift Hooks

A set of hooks to build simple, flexible, WAI-ARIA compliant React dropdown components.
Developed as a follow up on [this issue][hooks-issue] about using hooks in our API.

## Hooks

### useSelect

For a `<select>` custom dropdown [click here][select-readme].

## Roadmap and contributions

Next steps:

- complete testing for the `useSelect` hook and polishing API.
- create types (TS and Flow) for it or re-write it directly in Typescript.
- create `useAutocomplete` hook (the old Downshift default component) for the combobox design pattern.
- create `multiple` versions for `useSelect` and `useAutocomplete`.
