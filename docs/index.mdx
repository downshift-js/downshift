Primitives to build simple, flexible, WAI-ARIA compliant React
autocomplete/combobox or select dropdown components.

## The problem

You need an autocomplete/combobox or select experience in your application and
you want it to be accessible. You also want it to be simple and flexible to
account for your use cases.

## This solution

This library provides its users two main sets of solutions: the `Downshift`
component and a set of hooks. The component is still the main part of the
library, providing autocomplete/combobox accessibility logic as a render prop.
The hooks are newer and are going to be the way forward make widgets accessible.
Right now we support `useSelect` for custom `select` components and
`useCombobox` for `combobox/autocomplete` inputs. We also offer
`useMultipleSelection` to complement the first two hooks and easily cover the
experience of a multiple selection.

Since both `useCombobox` and the `Downshift` component aim to provide
accessibility to a combobox/autocomplete input, we suggest using the new
`useCombobox` first. If `Downshift` still covers your use case better then use
the component instead. Make sure to create an issue on [Github][github-page]
about your use case not being covered by the hook, since we may want that
functionality in `useCombobox` as well. Both the component and the hooks are
actively maintained but we are cool kids from the future and prefer to share
`React` logic via hooks.
