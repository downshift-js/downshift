Primitives to build simple, flexible, WAI-ARIA compliant React autocomplete,
combobox or select dropdown components.

## The problem

You need an autocomplete/combobox/select experience in your application and you
want it to be accessible. You also want it to be simple and flexible to account
for your use cases.

## This solution

This library provides its users two main sets of solutions: the `Downshift`
component and a set of hooks. The component is still the main part of the
library, providing autocomplete/combobox logic as a render prop. The hooks are
newer and are going to be the way forward to provide accessibility logic to
widgets. Right now we support `useSelect` for `select` components, `useCombobox`
for `combobox/autocomplete` and `useMultipleSelection` to make multiple
selection easier for the first two experiences.

Since `useCombobox` and the component `Downshift` aim to provide accessibility
to the same kind of widget, we suggest trying the new `useCombobox` and if you
feel that `Downshift` still covers your use case better then use that instead.
Both of them are actively maintained but we are cool kids from the future and
prefer to share `React` logic via hooks.
